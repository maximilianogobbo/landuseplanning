# Land Use and Cover

In this stage of work, we carried out an exploratory analysis of Brazilian land use and land cover data. The data used in the analysis were made available within the Branch “land use”. For the code in the .rmd file to work, these files must be associated with the working directory. The two .rmd files refer to the same text, one in English, the other in Portuguese (Brazil).
